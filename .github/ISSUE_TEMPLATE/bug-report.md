This includes the relevant contents of `~/.koto/debug.log`. You can paste raw
text, attach the file directly in the issue or link to the text via a pastebin
type site. Please also include any non-standard things you did during
compilation (extra flags, dependency version changes etc.) if applicable.

### Do you have a backup of `~/.koto` directory and/or take a VM snapshot?
- Backing up / making a copy of the `~/.koto` directory might help make the
  problem reproducible. Please redact appropriately.
- Taking a VM snapshot is really helpful for interactively testing fixes

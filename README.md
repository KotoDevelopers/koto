===========

What is Koto?
--------------

[Koto](https://ko-to.org/) is fork of [Zcash](https://z.cash/) which is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol.
Based on Bitcoin's code, Zcash intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy
through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves
confidentiality of transaction metadata. More technical details are available
in our [Protocol Specification](https://github.com/zcash/zips/raw/master/protocol/protocol.pdf).

This software is the Koto client. It downloads and stores the entire history
of Koto transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the
blockchain has reached a significant size.
